# Week-2
Mainly for my analysis and visualizations I used matplotlib, but also used seaborn for my boxplot. 
Histogram was my main tool used for analysis as it was most suitable for large values.
I've used Pandas to join my datasets together, before running analysis I done research for most suitable visualizations for my hypotysis.
I used those type of analysis as they provided me intake I wanted to get.
My results were mentions in ipyn file.
